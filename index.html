    <p class="info-text"> Our hedgehogs are 100% crafted by our local artisans. Each quill is perfectly put into place and we make sure that each hedgehog has at least 4000 quills. The hedgehogs we produce go through a rigorous inspection and must pass this test before being shipped out to you. Part of this testing program includes checking the buoyancy of the hoglet. All hoglets are fed 100% organic vegetables sourced locally by our professionally trained farmers. They also are fed organic farm fresh insects. Each hedgehog purchase includes a starter package, that includes: One (1) specialized feed bag, an owner instruction manual, and one (1) free random sweater and hat combination set for your prickle pal, when you sign up with our newsletter!
